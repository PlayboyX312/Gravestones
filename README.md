Adds Gravestones to store your items on death!
Includes numerous options to balance this, if you feel it's too unfair:
- Gravestones can be damaged over a configurable amount of time, after which they break and the items go on the ground (and then vanilla despawn rules apply)
- Gravestones can be damaged by repeated deaths, after which they break in the same way
- Gravestones can spawn mobs when their owners are nearby to defend the grave's contents

Also includes craftable aesthetic gravestones, which allow builders to use the gravestone blocks without the functionality.
